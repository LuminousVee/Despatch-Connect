## Usage

### Tourism Component
The Tourism component fetches and displays virtual tours, booking services, and a local business directory.

**File:** `src/components/tourism/Tourism.js`

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { Container, Grid, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
import VirtualTours from './VirtualTours';
import BookingServices from './BookingServices';
import LocalBusinessDirectory from './LocalBusinessDirectory';
import { fetchTourismData } from '../../store/actions/tourismActions';
import ErrorBoundary from '../common/ErrorBoundary';

function Tourism() {
  // Component logic here...
}
```

### Marketplace Component
The Marketplace component handles product listings, a shopping cart, and checkout functionality.

**File:** `src/components/marketplace/Marketplace.js`

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { Container, Grid, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
import ProductCatalog from './ProductCatalog';
import ShoppingCart from './ShoppingCart';
import Checkout from './Checkout';
import { fetchProducts } from '../../store/actions/marketplaceActions';
import ErrorBoundary from '../common/ErrorBoundary';

function Marketplace() {
  // Component logic here...
}
```

### Auth Component
The Auth component manages user authentication including login, registration, and user profile.

**File:** `src/components/auth/Auth.js`

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Switch, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import Login from './Login';
import Register from './Register';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

function Auth() {
  // Component logic here...
}
```

## State Management

The project uses Redux for state management. The application state is divided into various slices such as `tourism`, `marketplace`, and `auth`. Actions are dispatched to fetch data, register users, and manage user sessions.

## Testing

The project includes tests for components and actions using Jest and React Testing Library. Additionally, Cypress is used for end-to-end testing.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```

To run Cypress tests, use:
```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project is set up with a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Build**: Install dependencies and build the project.
2. **Test**: Run unit and integration tests.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the build artifacts to the specified S3 bucket for staging or production.
